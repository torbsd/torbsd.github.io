## REQUIRED indicates vital to an operational relay.

# REQUIRED: This line designates that the Tor node will relay traffic
SocksPort 0

# REQUIRED: Where the logs will dwell. It's necessary touch(1) the log file 
# and make owner and group _tor
Log notice file /var/log/tor.log

# REQUIRED: TCP port listening for Tor traffic
ORPort 9001

# The relay nickname appearing in Tor server listing
Nickname a-Tor-relay

# Set the rate and burst bandwidth limits in kilobytes
# Throttle traffic to 5000KB/s (40000Kbps),
# but allow bursts up to 6000KB/s (48000Kbps)
RelayBandwidthRate 5000 KB
RelayBandwidthBurst 6000 KB

# To run a directory server, the TCP port that advertises for connections
DirPort 9030

# For entities or admins running multiple relays, especially on the same host,
# use fingerprints to identify them

# To NOT allow exit traffic, i.e., to not be an exit node
# Although we do strongly encourage exploring that option
ExitPolicy reject *:* # no exits allowed

# If employing a firewall, should set statically to assign pass rule for
