<h2 id="whatistdp">What is <strong>TDP</strong>?</h2>

<p>The <strong>Tor BSD Diversity Project (TDP)</strong> is an initiative seeking to extend the use of the BSD Unix operating systems in the Tor public anonymity network.</p>

<p>The Tor Project continues to play a critical role in anonymity and privacy solutions. With increasing surveillance and censorship, Tor is a vital tool, and the project has grown by leaps-and-bounds since originating with the US Naval Labs in the 1990’s. Hundreds of thousands rely on Tor’s in a world filled with threats to anonymity and privacy.</p>

<p>While recognizing that the Tor Project is dynamic open source project with a vibrant community, we are also concerned with the overwhelming GNU/Linux monoculture that is an Achilles’ Heel. Monocultures in nature are dangerous, as vulnerabilities are held in common across a broad spectrum. Diversity means single vulnerabilities are less likely to harm the entire ecosystem. In a global anonymity network, monocultures are potentially disastrous. A single kernel vulnerability in GNU/Linux impacting Tor relays could be devastating. We want to see a stronger Tor network, and we believe one critical ingredient for that is operating system diversity.</p>

<h2 id="therearethreeaspectsofthetdp’sapproach:">There are three aspects of the <strong>TDP’s</strong> approach:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>To increase the number of Tor relays running *BSDs, focused on the server/network layer</p></li>
<li><p>To develop a solid, Tor-compatible browser easily portable to other POSIX-based operating systems, focused on the client layer</p></li>
<li><p>To engage the broader *BSD community about the Tor anonymity network</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="currenttdpworkincludes:">Current <strong>TDP</strong> work includes:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Guides for configuring FreeBSD and OpenBSD relays</p></li>
<li><p>The creation of an OpenBSD Tor Browser port</p></li>
<li><p>Organizing various events for engaging *BSD users about Tor, including birds-of-a-feather sessions and informal meetings</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tdpsuccessdependsonbroaderbsdcommunityinvolvement."><strong>TDP</strong> success depends on broader *BSD community involvement.</h2>
