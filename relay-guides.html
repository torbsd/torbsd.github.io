<h2 id="tdpfreebsdopenbsdguidesfortorrelays"><strong>TDP</strong> FreeBSD &amp; OpenBSD Guides for Tor Relays</h2>

<p><strong>THESE ARE PRELIMINARY WORKS AT THE EARLY STAGE. ANONYMITY IS NOT A GAME, SO PLEASE DO NOT JUST ASSUME THESE GUIDES ARE FINE AS-IS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.</strong></p>

<p><strong>TDP</strong> is creating two guides to building and configuring Tor relays for FreeBSD and OpenBSD.</p>

<p>There will be two versions of each.</p>

<p>The first one will be guides to getting a Tor relay up quickly.</p>

<p>The second will be some other ideas for configuration, covering more optional enhancements.</p>

<p>One issue to note is that we view various optimization attempts as a
complex road.</p>

<p>It is not easy to measure the true effects of sysctl value changes and other kernel-level hacks, particularly with TCP traffic. Tor is a (more or less) randomized routing network. That lack of consistency inhibits comparisons in performance beyond the obvious. Tor relay traffic can vary wildly day-to-day and month-to-month, regardless of any system optimization. For a useful overview of the problems with testing, see Kode Vicious&#8217; <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2732268">reply to &#8220;How Not Why&#8221;</a> in ACM&#8217;s Queue magazine from February 2015. His emphasis on repeatability tends to undercut many assumptions that are made about testing a host on an anonymity network. It can quickly degenerate into being a blind, counter-productive endeavor.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, there are some system-level changes we do recommend. But
do not expect long lists of sysctl values and graphs illustrating the
effects.</p>

<p><strong>TDP</strong> will look at optimizing Tor relay performance on
high-bandwidth BSDs in the future, but we suspect that the default
operating system installs (outside of some recommended changes) should
be sufficient for most relay operators&#8217; hardware and bandwidth. If
Netflix can serve
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL5U4wr86L4/">one-third of peak internet traffic in North America</a>
with a default FreeBSD install, it is likely sufficient for the vast
majority of Tor relays without any changes to the operating system.</p>

<p>Contributions from other BSDs are welcomed.</p>
