| Running Tor Brower 5.5 on OpenBSD
+-------------------------------------------------------

Tor Brower 5.5 for OpenBSD (TB) is a port of the Tor Project's
TB.

There are a number of significant differences with the standard TB
port.

Most importantly, TB's torrc file is located in ~/.tor-browser, as opposed
to /etc/tor/torrc for the default net/tor package. All changes
in the Tor Network Settings menu item will appear in that location.

The default torrc file only contains the following settings:

    DataDirectory /home/$user/.tor-browser/tor_data
    HiddenServiceStatistics 0

The ~/.tor-browser/torrc file can also be used to make other standard
Tor configuration changes. For instance, to avoid using a particular
country's exit nodes for the TB's Tor circuits, add the following line to
~/tor-browser/torrc:

    ExcludeExitNodes $two-digit-country-code

Or to limit the number of writes to disk by TB:

    AvoidDiskWrites 1

Debugging
=========
If you encounter any problems with TB, the current version has
verbose debugging enabled by default to assist diagnosing problems.

If you encounter an issue please save the spew to a file and send
it to us, e.g.:

    $ /usr/local/bin/tor-browser >~/spew-file 2>&1

Will write all of the messages that come out of tor-browser to `spew-file`
in your home directory.
