<h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>

<p>The <strong>Tor BSD Diversity Project (TDP)</strong> is an initiative seeking to
extend the use of the BSD Unix operating systems in the
<a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor public anonymity network</a>.</p>

<p>BSD Unix is an open source operating system family noted for its
security and stability. The primary BSD projects include
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a>, <a href="https://www.netbsd.org">NetBSD</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> and
<a href="http://www.dragonflybsd.org">DragonFly BSD</a>, with a number of
tangential projects including <a href="https://www.pfsense.org">pfSense</a>,
<a href="https://www.freenas.org">FreeNAS</a> and
<a href="https://www.pcbsd.org">PC-BSD</a>. BSD software such as
<a href="http://www.openssh.com">OpenSSH</a> is the default communication tool
for innumerable devices on the internet. Firms such as Netflix, WhatsApp and Juniper rely on BSD systems and code to build and maintain resilient services and devices.</p>

<p>Originating at the University of California in the 1970&#8217;s, BSD software is renowned for its Internet infrastructure role since its earliest days.</p>

<p>The Tor Project plays a critical component in anonymity
and privacy solutions. With increasing surveillance and censorship,
Tor is a vital tool, and the project has grown by leaps-and-bounds
since its creation at the US Naval Labs in the 1990’s. Millions
rely on Tor’s operation in a world filled with threats to
anonymity and privacy.</p>

<p>While recognizing the Tor Project is a dynamic open source project
with a vibrant community, we are also concerned with the overwhelming
GNU/Linux monoculture that is an Achilles’ Heel. Monocultures in
nature are dangerous, as vulnerabilities are held in common across a
broad spectrum. In contrast, diversity means single vulnerabilities are less likely
to harm the entire ecosystem. In a global anonymity network,
monocultures are potentially disastrous. A single kernel vulnerability
in GNU/Linux impacting Tor relays could be devastating. We want to see
a stronger Tor network, and we believe one critical ingredient for
that is operating system diversity.</p>

<p>There are three aspects of the <strong>TDP’s</strong> approach:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Increase the number of Tor relays running BSDs. We envision this
 happening by increasing the total number of relays, with the addition
 of more BSD users running relays;</p></li>
<li><p>Make the Tor Browser available under BSD operating systems
 using native packaging mechanisms. Our first target is OpenBSD;</p></li>
<li><p>Engage the broader BSD community about the Tor anonymity network and
 the place that BSD Unix should occupy in the privacy community at
 large.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Current <strong>TDP</strong> work includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="relay-guides.html">Guides for configuring and running FreeBSD and OpenBSD relays</a>;</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/torbsd/openbsd-ports">The creation of OpenBSD Tor Browser ports</a>;</p></li>
<li><p>Organizing various events for engaging BSD users about Tor,
 including presentations, birds-of-a-feather sessions and informal meetings;</p></li>
<li><p><a href="corp-relays.html">Enlisting BSD-using entities</a> to operate Tor relays</p></li>
<li><p>Accumulating and maintaining a list of privacy-enhancing related ports and their statuses on the BSDs, in a project entitled <a href="porting-pets.html">Porting Targets for PETs</a></p></li>
<li><p>Maintaining a set of reports entitled <a href="dirty-stats.html">&#8220;Quick-and-Dirty Statistics&#8221;</a> which provide snapshots of public Tor relay diversity</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We look forward to inquiries and involvement in <strong>TDP</strong>. Fork our <a href="https://github.com/torbsd">code</a>, submit patches, run a relay and let us know if <strong>TDP</strong>
documentation was useful.</p>
