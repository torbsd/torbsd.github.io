<h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>

<p><strong>The Tor BSD Diversity Project (TDP)</strong> is an initiative seeking to
extend the use of the BSD Unix operating systems in the
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor public anonymity network</a>.</p>

<p>BSD Unix is an open source operating system family noted for its
security and stability. The primary BSD projects include
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>, <a href="https://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> and
<a href="http://www.dragonflybsd.org/">DragonFly BSD</a>, with a number of
tangential projects including <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/">pfSense</a>,
<a href="https://www.freenas.org/">FreeNAS</a> and
<a href="https://www.pcbsd.org/">PC-BSD</a>. BSD software such as
<a href="http://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a> is the default communication tool
for innumerable devices on the Internet. Firms such as Netflix, WhatsApp and Juniper rely on BSD systems and code to build and maintain resilient services and<br/>
devices.</p>

<p>Originating at the University of California in the 1970&#8217;s, BSD software is renowned for its Internet infrastructure role since its earliest days.</p>

<p>The Tor Project plays a critical component for internet anonymity
and privacy solutions. With increasing surveillance and censorship,
Tor is a vital tool, and the project has grown by leaps-and-bounds
since its creation at the US Naval Labs in the 1990’s. Millions
rely on Tor’s operation in a world filled with internet surveillance and censorship.</p>

<p><strong>While recognizing the Tor Project is a dynamic open source project with a vibrant community, we are also concerned with the overwhelming GNU/Linux monoculture that is an Achilles’ Heel. Monocultures in nature are dangerous, as vulnerabilities are held in common across a broad spectrum. In contrast, diversity means single vulnerabilities are less likely to harm the entire ecosystem. In a global anonymity network, monocultures are potentially disastrous. A single kernel vulnerability in GNU/Linux impacting Tor relays could be devastating. We want to see a stronger Tor network, and we believe one critical ingredient for that is operating system diversity.</strong></p>

<p>There are three aspects of the <strong>TDP’s</strong> approach:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Increase the number of Tor relays running BSDs. We envision this
 happening by increasing the total number of relays, with more BSD
 users running relays;</p></li>
<li><p>Make the Tor Browser available under BSD operating systems
 using native packaging mechanisms with OpenBSD as the initial target;</p></li>
<li><p>Engage the broader BSD community about the Tor anonymity network and
 the place that BSD Unix should occupy in the privacy community at
 large.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Current <strong>TDP</strong> <a href="projects.html">work</a> includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="relay-guides.html">Guides for configuring and running FreeBSD and OpenBSD relays</a>;</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/torbsd/openbsd-ports/">The creation of OpenBSD Tor Browser ports</a>;</p></li>
<li><p>Organizing various events for engaging BSD users about Tor,
 including presentations, birds-of-a-feather sessions and informal meetings;</p></li>
<li><p><a href="corp-relays.html">Enlisting BSD-using entities</a> to operate Tor relays;</p></li>
<li><p>Accumulating and maintaining a list of privacy-enhancing related ports and their statuses on the BSDs, in a project entitled <a href="porting-pets.html">Porting Targets for PETs</a>;</p></li>
<li><p>Maintaining a set of reports entitled <a href="dirty-stats.html">&#8220;Quick-and-Dirty Statistics&#8221;</a> which provide snapshots of public Tor relay diversity;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We look forward to inquiries about and involvement in <strong>TDP</strong>. Fork our <a href="https://github.com/torbsd/">code</a>, submit patches, run a BSD relay and let us know if <strong>TDP</strong> documentation was useful.</p>
