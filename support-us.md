## TDP Seeks Funding Support ##

__The Tor BSD Diversity Project__ is looking for financial support through grants or other mediums.

__TDP__ launched in March 2015, and works to strengthen the Tor public anonymity network by increasing operating system diversity with the BSD Unix operating systems.

Since our beginnings, __TDP__ successfully achieved a number of significant milestones:

* produced five releases of Tor Browser for [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org), with the repository residing [on GitHub](https://github.com/torbsd)

* conducted a number of successful presentations at [BSDCan 2015](https://www.bsdcan.org/2015/) and [BSDCon Brazil](http://2015.bsdcon.com.br), engaging with scores of individuals about __TDP__ and the critical importance of involving BSD users and developers in Tor ecosystem

*Our advocacy efforts made Brazil a country of one periodic public BSD Tor relay to about a fifth of the relays, accounting for up to a third of public Tor bandwidth in that country*

* enlisted [New York Internet](https://www.nyi.net) to donate two high-bandwidth public relays at its facility in Bridgewater, New Jersey, with the aim of replicating Mozilla's roll-out of Tor relays among firms that employ the *BSDs

* started [how-to guides](relay-guides.html) for building Tor relays on FreeBSD and OpenBSD

* commenced producing a series of [quick and simple reports](dirty-stats.html) highlighting diversity weaknesses in the Tor network

* [documented an array of common PETs](porting-pets.html)--privacy-enhancing technologies--and their status in the various BSD ports systems, encouraging BSD port developers to approach and investigate their adoption

__TDP__ already has a proven track record as a project. But __TDP__ wants to do more. Each and every one of our accomplishments is only a first step in a larger set of goals.

* we want to release a maintained Tor Browser for OpenBSD's stable branch

* we want to enhance efforts to port Tor Browser to other BSDs

* we want to push some of our code changes upstream into the Tor Project and even Mozilla

* we want to conduct more presentations, birds-of-feather sessions and public meetings about __TDP__ including [BSDCan](https://www.bsdcan.org/) in 2016, plus a public presentation and maybe a Tor Browser hackathon in NYC in late winter

* we want to target more potential Tor relay operators in countries with few or no relays through our contacts in the *BSD community, and [EuroBSDCon 2016](https://2016.eurobsdcon.org) is scheduled for Belgrade, Serbia (RS), a country and region (Croatia/HR, Slovenia/SI, Bosnia and Herzegovina/BA, Macedonia/MK, Montenegro/ME and others) where the sum total of public Tor relays is in the single-digits

* we want to enlist more BSD-using firms to run high-bandwidth Tor relays, employing our networks of contacts through the community

* we want our relay guides to be production ready, and translated to languages beyond English, particularly into those common in countries with low relay counts

* we want to port more PETs applications to the BSDs, and to facilitate others to join the efforts

* most vitally, we want to enlist more BSD developers into __TDP's__ efforts, which has already begun

We aren't limiting __TDP__ to those goals. __TDP__ is a dynamic project aiming to adjust to any opportunity to strengthen the Tor network. __TDP__ has a track record and a trajectory of moving forward. 

At this point, __TDP__ is self-funded with resources, time and labor. But those coffers are not limitless. __TDP__ is proud of the accomplishments so far, but the current pace is unsustainable without funding.

Please contact __TDP__ if interested in assisting our efforts to allow us to continue the current objectives, and to expand them.
