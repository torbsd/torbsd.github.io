TB onto OpenBSD


Where standards decide all, therefore easiest OS to port *from*
not going to find POSIX "extensions" and esoteric ports	

They don't rely on bloated assumptions, even upstream
GPG for signing and verifying? signify(1)
a pretend-developer writes an RNG? arc4random(3)

I don't know OpenBSD user-base versus other BSDs
but neither do you

If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere
