## Welcome ##

The __Tor BSD Diversity Project (TDP)__ is an initiative seeking to
extend the use of the BSD Unix operating systems in the
[Tor public anonymity network](https://www.torproject.org/).

BSD Unix is an open source operating system family noted for its
security and stability. The primary BSD projects include
[FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/), [NetBSD](https://www.netbsd.org/),
[OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org/) and
[DragonFly BSD](http://www.dragonflybsd.org/), with a number of
tangential projects including [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/),
[FreeNAS](https://www.freenas.org/) and
[PC-BSD](https://www.pcbsd.org/). BSD software such as
[OpenSSH](http://www.openssh.com/) is the default communication tool
for innumerable devices on the Internet. Firms such as Netflix, WhatsApp and Juniper rely on BSD systems and code to build and maintain resilient services and devices.

Originating at the University of California in the 1970's, BSD software is renowned for its Internet infrastructure role since its earliest days.

The Tor Project plays a critical component for internet anonymity
and privacy solutions. With increasing surveillance and censorship,
Tor is a vital tool, and the project has grown by leaps-and-bounds
since its creation at the US Naval Labs in the 1990’s. Millions 
rely on Tor’s operation in a world filled with internet surveillance and censorship.

__While recognizing the Tor Project is a dynamic open source project with a vibrant community, we are also concerned with the overwhelming GNU/Linux monoculture that is an Achilles’ Heel. Monocultures in nature are dangerous, as vulnerabilities are held in common across a broad spectrum. In contrast, diversity means single vulnerabilities are less likely to harm the entire ecosystem. In a global anonymity network, monocultures are potentially disastrous. A single kernel vulnerability in GNU/Linux impacting Tor relays could be devastating. We want to see a stronger Tor network, and we believe one critical ingredient for that is operating system diversity.__

There are three aspects of the __TDP’s__ approach:

* Increase the number of Tor relays running BSDs.  We envision this
  happening by increasing the total number of relays, with more BSD
  users running relays;

* Make the Tor Browser available under BSD operating systems
  using native packaging mechanisms with OpenBSD as the initial target;

* Engage the broader BSD community about the Tor anonymity network and
  the place that BSD Unix should occupy in the privacy community at
  large.

Current __TDP__ [work](projects.html) includes:

* [Guides for configuring and running FreeBSD and OpenBSD relays](relay-guides.html);

* [The creation of OpenBSD Tor Browser ports](https://github.com/torbsd/openbsd-ports/);

* Organizing various events for engaging BSD users about Tor,
  including presentations, birds-of-a-feather sessions and informal meetings;

* [Enlisting BSD-using entities](corp-relays.html) to operate Tor relays;

* Accumulating and maintaining a list of privacy-enhancing related ports and their statuses on the BSDs, in a project entitled [Porting Targets for PETs](porting-pets.html);

* Maintaining a set of reports entitled ["Quick-and-Dirty Statistics"](dirty-stats.html) which provide snapshots of public Tor relay diversity;

We look forward to inquiries about and involvement in __TDP__.  Fork our [code]
(https://github.com/torbsd/), submit patches, run a BSD relay and let us know if __TDP__ documentation was useful.

Please see our [contact page](contact.html) if you want to get in touch with us.
