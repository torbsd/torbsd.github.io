<h2 id="tdpseeksfundingsupport">TDP Seeks Funding Support</h2>

<p><strong>The Tor BSD Diversity Project</strong> is looking for financial support through grants or other mediums.</p>

<p><strong>TDP</strong> launched in March 2015, and works to strengthen the Tor public anonymity network by increasing operating system diversity with the BSD Unix operating systems.</p>

<p>Since our beginnings, <strong>TDP</strong> successfully achieved a number of significant milestones:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>produced seven releases of Tor Browser for <a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>, with the repository residing <a href="https://github.com/torbsd">on GitHub</a></p></li>
<li><p>conducted a number of successful presentations at <a href="https://www.bsdcan.org/2015/">BSDCan 2015</a> and <a href="http://2015.bsdcon.com.br">BSDCon Brazil</a>, engaging with scores of individuals about <strong>TDP</strong> and the critical importance of involving BSD users and developers in Tor ecosystem</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Our advocacy efforts made Brazil a country of one periodic public BSD Tor relay to about a fifth of the relays, accounting for up to a third of public Tor bandwidth in that country</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>enlisted <a href="https://www.nyi.net">New York Internet</a> to donate two high-bandwidth public relays at its facility in Bridgewater, New Jersey, with the aim of replicating Mozilla&#8217;s roll-out of Tor relays among firms that employ the *BSDs</p></li>
<li><p>started <a href="relay-guides.html">how-to guides</a> for building Tor relays on FreeBSD and OpenBSD</p></li>
<li><p>commenced producing a series of <a href="dirty-stats.html">quick and simple reports</a> highlighting diversity weaknesses in the Tor network</p></li>
<li><p><a href="porting-pets.html">documented an array of common PETs</a>&#8211;privacy-enhancing technologies&#8211;and their status in the various BSD ports systems, encouraging BSD port developers to approach and investigate their adoption</p></li>
<li><p>In January 2013, under 4% of public Tor relays were running a BSD Unix, while today the number hovers around the 5.25% range. While we can&#8217;t directly attribute it to <strong>TDP</strong>, we believe our development and advocacy work impacted this change.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TDP</strong> already has a proven track record as a project. But <strong>TDP</strong> wants to do more. Each and every one of our accomplishments is only a first step in a larger set of goals.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>we want to release a maintained Tor Browser for OpenBSD&#8217;s stable branch</p></li>
<li><p>we want to enhance efforts to port Tor Browser to other BSDs</p></li>
<li><p>we want to push some of our code changes upstream into the Tor Project and even Mozilla</p></li>
<li><p>we want to conduct more presentations, birds-of-feather sessions and public meetings about <strong>TDP</strong> including <a href="https://www.bsdcan.org/">BSDCan</a> in 2016, plus a public presentation and maybe a Tor Browser hackathon in NYC in 2016</p></li>
<li><p>we want to target more potential Tor relay operators in countries with few or no relays through our contacts in the *BSD community, and <a href="https://2016.eurobsdcon.org">EuroBSDCon 2016</a> is scheduled for Belgrade, Serbia (RS), a country and region (Croatia/HR, Slovenia/SI, Bosnia and Herzegovina/BA, Macedonia/MK, Montenegro/ME and others) where the sum total of public Tor relays is in the single-digits</p></li>
<li><p>we want to enlist more BSD-using firms to run high-bandwidth Tor relays, employing our networks of contacts around the community</p></li>
<li><p>we want our relay guides to be production ready, and translated to languages beyond English, particularly into those common in countries with low relay counts</p></li>
<li><p>we want to port more PETs applications to the BSDs, and to facilitate others to join the efforts</p></li>
<li><p>most vitally, we want to enlist more BSD developers into <strong>TDP&#8217;s</strong> efforts, which has already begun</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We aren&#8217;t limiting <strong>TDP</strong> to those goals. <strong>TDP</strong> is a dynamic project aiming to adjust to any opportunity to strengthen the Tor network. <strong>TDP</strong> has a track record and a trajectory of moving forward. </p>

<p>At this point, <strong>TDP</strong> is self-funded with resources, time and labor. But those coffers are not limitless. <strong>TDP</strong> is proud of the accomplishments so far, but the current pace is unsustainable without funding.</p>

<p>Please contact <strong>TDP</strong> if interested in assisting our efforts to allow us to continue the current objectives, and to expand them. </p>

<p>Finally, an image for your enjoyment:</p>
